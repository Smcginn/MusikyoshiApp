To build:

The SeeScoreLib.framework files have gotten too large for GitHub.
They have been replaced by .zip files.
When checking out or updating a working copy it will be necessary to unzip those frameworks.

You may also need to set your team name, found under Project (top of left-side navigation bar) -> General -> Team.
