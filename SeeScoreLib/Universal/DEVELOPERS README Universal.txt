The SeeScore framework files must be downloaded from GoogleDrive and unzipped. The app will not build until you perform this step. 

See DEVELOPERS README.txt in the parent SeeScore directory for complete detailed instructions.

(To avoid any issues with stale files, first move the SeeScoreLib.framework folder to Trash before downloading and unzipping the V365 framework libraries. You can leave this text file in place.)

Make sure to place and unzip AppStore-Release-SeeScoreLib.framework.zip and Universal-SeeScoreLib.framework.zip in the correct, corresponding directories.

For this release, you want Version 365.
