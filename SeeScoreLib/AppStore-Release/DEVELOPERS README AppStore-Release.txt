The SeeScore framework files must be downloaded from GoogleDrive and unzipped. The app will not build until you perform this step. 

See DEVELOPERS README.txt in the parent SeeScore directory for complete detailed instructions.

Make sure to place and unzip AppStore-Release-SeeScoreLib.framework.zip and Universal-SeeScoreLib.framework.zip in the correct, corresponding directories.

For this release, you want Version 330.
